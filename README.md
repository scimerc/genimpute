# genimpute
integrated tool set to perform quality control and imputation of diploid genotypes

this tool set was written by Florian Krull and me loosely based on the deCODE genetics protocol adapted by Sudheer Giddaluru.

NOTE: the tool set is currently designed to run in linux.
      
run

    genimpute.sh -h
    
to get usage instructions.
